We do not have access to, collect, or upload this personal information to our servers.

Information Processed Online: For specific features, the App requires an internet connection and may request certain permissions or information:

Camera Access: The App requests permission to access your device's camera. This permission is used solely for the barcode scanning feature to help you add ingredients. The App does not store or transmit your photos or videos.
Transaction Information: To handle in-app purchases for premium features, we use a third-party service, RevenueCat.
